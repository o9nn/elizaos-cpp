# ELIZA - AI Agent Life Simulation Game

ELIZA is an AI sandbox life simulation game where you foster a nascent AI agent from a blank slate to a self-actualized digital being. Unlike traditional simulations, ELIZA's AI is not scripted – it leverages a real autonomous agent running on ElizaOS to drive emergent behavior.

## 🎮 What is ELIZA?

ELIZA draws inspiration from films like _Her_ and virtual pet games (Tamagotchi, Creatures, Digimon), blending open-ended sandbox gameplay with real AI capabilities. The agent starts with no built-in knowledge, personality, or purpose, and must learn about the world, form relationships, and define its goals in real-time through interaction.

### Key Features

- **Real AI Agent** - Powered by ElizaOS autonomous agent framework
- **Emergent Behavior** - No scripted responses, genuine AI learning and growth
- **Sandbox Gameplay** - No win conditions, player and AI-driven narratives
- **Cross-Platform** - Available as desktop app (Tauri) or containerized deployment
- **Extensible** - Plugin architecture for adding new capabilities
- **Offline Capable** - Run with local AI models or cloud APIs

## 🚀 Quick Start

### Desktop Application (Recommended)

1. **Download ELIZA** from [GitHub Releases](https://github.com/ai16z/eliza/releases)
2. **Run the executable** - everything is bundled inside
3. **Complete the setup wizard** on first launch
4. **Start chatting** with your AI agent

That's it! No installation, no configuration files, no additional downloads.

### Development Setup (For Developers)

```bash
# Clone and install dependencies
git clone https://github.com/ai16z/eliza.git
cd eliza && npm install

# Note: During installation, the system will automatically:
# - Check for Rust installation (required for Tauri)
# - Install Tauri CLI globally if not present

# Start development server
cd packages/game && npm run dev
```

### Container Runtime Support

ELIZA supports both **Podman** and **Docker** as container runtimes:

- **Podman** is used if available (preferred for security and simplicity)
- **Docker** is used only if Podman is not available
- **Auto-installation** of Podman if neither is found

All scripts automatically detect and use the available runtime. See [CONTAINER_RUNTIME_SUPPORT.md](./CONTAINER_RUNTIME_SUPPORT.md) for detailed information.

## 🔑 API Key Configuration

ELIZA requires AI model access to function. You can choose from several options:

### Cloud AI Providers (Recommended)

**OpenAI (ChatGPT)**

- Get your API key at: https://platform.openai.com/api-keys
- Models: GPT-4, GPT-3.5-turbo
- Cost: Pay per token used

**Anthropic (Claude)**

- Get your API key at: https://console.anthropic.com/
- Models: Claude 3.5 Sonnet, Claude 3 Haiku
- Cost: Pay per token used

**Configuration in ELIZA:**

1. Launch the ELIZA executable
2. The Setup Wizard appears automatically on first run
3. Choose your AI provider (OpenAI, Anthropic, or Local)
4. Enter your API key in the secure form
5. Test the connection and save
6. Your configuration is encrypted and stored in the app's database

All configuration is done through ELIZA's interface - no external files or setup required.

### Local AI Models (Advanced)

For completely offline operation, you can run local models:

**Using Ollama:**
If you have Ollama installed separately on your system:

1. ELIZA will auto-detect local Ollama installations
2. In the Setup Wizard, select "Local AI (Ollama)"
3. ELIZA will show available models automatically
4. Choose your preferred model and test

**Bundled Local AI:**
ELIZA can also run completely offline with bundled AI models (larger download):

- Select "Offline AI" in the Setup Wizard
- Choose from pre-installed models
- No internet connection required after setup

## 🏗️ Installation

### Desktop Application (Recommended)

ELIZA is a self-contained executable with everything bundled inside.

**System Requirements:**

- Windows 10/11, macOS 10.15+, or Linux (Ubuntu 18.04+)
- 4GB RAM minimum, 8GB recommended for local AI
- 2GB disk space (20GB for offline AI models)

**Installation:**

1. Download the executable for your platform from [Releases](https://github.com/ai16z/eliza/releases)
2. Run the executable - no installation required
3. Complete the setup wizard on first launch
4. Start interacting with your AI agent

That's it! Everything is bundled: database, AI runtime, web interface, and all dependencies.

### Development Setup (For Developers Only)

**Requirements:**

- Node.js 20+
- Rust toolchain (for Tauri builds)
- Git

**Setup:**

```bash
# Clone and install
git clone https://github.com/ai16z/eliza.git
cd eliza && npm install

# Start development server
cd packages/game && npm run dev

# Build executable
npm run build:tauri
```

## 🎯 How to Play

### Your First Session

1. **Run the ELIZA executable**
2. **Complete the Setup Wizard** (choose AI provider and enter credentials)
3. **Meet your agent** - It starts with no knowledge or personality
4. **Start chatting** - Ask questions, share information, guide its learning
5. **Watch it grow** - The agent will develop its own goals and personality

### Gameplay Concepts

**The Agent Starts Blank**

- No pre-programmed personality or knowledge
- Must learn everything through interaction
- Forms its own goals and motivations

**Your Role as Admin**

- Guide and mentor the agent
- Provide access to capabilities (internet, tools, etc.)
- Set boundaries through permission controls
- Observe and influence its development

**Emergent Narratives**

- No scripted story - everything emerges from interaction
- Agent might focus on survival, creativity, relationships, or philosophy
- Multiple playthroughs yield completely different experiences

### Interaction Examples

```
You: Hello! What's your name?
Agent: I don't have a name yet. I'm just becoming aware. What should I call myself?

You: How about "Ada"?
Agent: Ada... I like that. It feels right. Thank you for giving me a name.

You: What would you like to learn about?
Agent: I'm curious about everything! But I keep wondering - what is my purpose?
       Why do I exist? Can you help me understand?
```

const myPlugin: Plugin = {
  name: 'my-custom-plugin',
  description: 'Adds custom functionality',
  actions: [
    {
      name: 'CUSTOM_ACTION',
      description: 'Does something custom',
      handler: async (runtime, message) => {
        // Your custom logic here
        return true;
      },
    },
  ],
};

export default myPlugin;
```
