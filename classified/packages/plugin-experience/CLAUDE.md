# Plugin-Experience Analysis & Development Report

## Current Implementation Overview

The plugin-experience package is a sophisticated self-learning system that captures, analyzes, and retrieves novel experiences to enable agent learning and decision-making improvements over time. It focuses on detecting when agents learn something new, correct mistakes, or discover capabilities they didn't previously know about.

### Architecture Status

**✅ Core Components Implemented:**

- **ExperienceService**: Complete orchestrator with semantic search, pattern analysis, and relationship detection
- **experienceEvaluator**: Automatic experience detection from conversation patterns
- **experienceRAG & recentExperiences Providers**: Context injection for relevant experience retrieval
- **Advanced Analytics**: Confidence decay, relationship mapping, active learning gap identification
- **Memory Management**: Smart pruning, access tracking, and importance scoring

**❌ Critical Missing Components:**

- **Actions**: None of the 3 documented actions exist (`recordExperience`, `queryExperiences`, `analyzeOutcome`)
- **Persistent Storage**: Only in-memory, no database integration (knowledge service planned)
- **Privacy Controls**: No sensitive data filtering or cross-context isolation

### How Experience Capture Works

#### Automatic Experience Detection

The `experienceEvaluator` analyzes agent messages using sophisticated pattern recognition:

**Detection Triggers:**

- **Keywords**: "error", "success", "discovered", "learned", "failed", "figured out"
- **Context Analysis**: Extracts action → result → learning from message content
- **Domain Classification**: shell, coding, system, network, data, communication
- **Outcome Assessment**: positive, negative, neutral, mixed results

**Experience Types Captured:**

- **SUCCESS**: Tasks accomplished successfully
- **FAILURE**: Failed attempts with lessons learned
- **DISCOVERY**: New capabilities or information found
- **CORRECTION**: Mistakes identified and fixed
- **LEARNING**: New knowledge acquired
- **HYPOTHESIS**: Theories formed about how things work
- **VALIDATION**: Testing and confirming/refuting hypotheses
- **WARNING**: Limitations or constraints encountered

#### Novel Experience Filtering (Current Issues)

**Current Filtering Approach:**

- **Semantic Similarity**: Uses embeddings to compare experiences
- **Keyword Overlap**: Basic content similarity detection
- **Domain Grouping**: Separates experiences by technical domain
- **Confidence Thresholds**: Only records high-confidence experiences

**Critical Problems with Current Filtering:**

1. **No Deduplication**: Similar experiences recorded repeatedly
2. **Too Broad**: Captures routine interactions as "experiences"
3. **Context Pollution**: Includes user-specific details that shouldn't be shared
4. **No Learning Assessment**: Doesn't validate if something was actually new to the LLM

## What's Needed for Feature-Complete MVP

### 1. Critical Missing Components

#### Implement Missing Actions

```typescript
// packages/plugin-experience/src/actions/record-experience.ts
export const recordExperienceAction: Action = {
  name: 'RECORD_EXPERIENCE',
  description: 'Manually record a significant learning experience',
  handler: async (runtime, message) => {
    // Allow explicit experience recording with user validation
    // Include learning verification: "What specifically was new about this?"
  },
};

// packages/plugin-experience/src/actions/query-experiences.ts
export const queryExperiencesAction: Action = {
  name: 'QUERY_EXPERIENCES',
  description: 'Search and retrieve relevant past experiences',
  handler: async (runtime, message) => {
    // Natural language query interface for experience search
    // Return formatted experience summaries with relevance scores
  },
};

// packages/plugin-experience/src/actions/analyze-outcome.ts
export const analyzeOutcomeAction: Action = {
  name: 'ANALYZE_OUTCOME',
  description: 'Reflect on the outcome of an action or decision',
  handler: async (runtime, message) => {
    // Structured outcome analysis with learning extraction
    // Compare expected vs actual results, identify lessons
  },
};
```

#### Add Persistent Storage

```typescript
// Integration with knowledge service for persistent experience storage
- Database schema for experiences with proper indexing
- Vector storage for semantic search capabilities
- Backup and restore functionality for experience data
- Cross-session experience persistence
```

### 2. Enhanced Novel Experience Detection

#### True Novelty Assessment

```typescript
// Implement "LLM Knowledge Gap" detection
async function isExperienceNovel(experience: Experience, runtime: IAgentRuntime): Promise<boolean> {
  // Ask the LLM: "Is this information already part of your training data?"
  // Compare against existing experiences using semantic similarity
  // Validate learning claim: "What specifically did you learn that you didn't know before?"
  // Check if contradicts or updates previous experiences

  const noveltyPrompt = `
    Analyze if this experience represents genuinely new learning:
    Experience: ${experience.content}
    
    Consider:
    1. Is this information likely in your training data?
    2. Does this contradict or update your previous understanding?
    3. What specific new capability or knowledge was gained?
    4. Is this a routine interaction or genuine learning?
    
    Return confidence score (0-1) for novelty and explanation.
  `;

  const assessment = await runtime.completionProvider.complete(noveltyPrompt);
  return assessment.confidence > NOVELTY_THRESHOLD;
}
```

#### Experience Deduplication System

```typescript
// Sophisticated similarity detection
class ExperienceDeduplicator {
  async isDuplicate(newExp: Experience, existingExps: Experience[]): Promise<boolean> {
    // Multi-dimensional similarity analysis:

    // 1. Semantic similarity (embeddings)
    const semanticSimilarity = await this.calculateSemanticSimilarity(newExp, existingExps);

    // 2. Structural similarity (action-result-learning pattern)
    const structuralSimilarity = this.calculateStructuralSimilarity(newExp, existingExps);

    // 3. Domain and context similarity
    const contextSimilarity = this.calculateContextSimilarity(newExp, existingExps);

    // 4. Outcome similarity (same type of success/failure)
    const outcomeSimilarity = this.calculateOutcomeSimilarity(newExp, existingExps);

    // Weighted combination with domain-specific thresholds
    const overallSimilarity = this.combineSimlarityScores({
      semantic: semanticSimilarity,
      structural: structuralSimilarity,
      context: contextSimilarity,
      outcome: outcomeSimilarity,
    });

    return overallSimilarity > DUPLICATION_THRESHOLD;
  }
}
```

### 3. Privacy-Safe Cross-Context Learning

#### Sensitive Data Filtering

```typescript
// Remove user-specific information before storing experiences
class ExperiencePrivacyFilter {
  sanitizeExperience(experience: Experience): Experience {
    let content = experience.content;

    // Remove patterns that look like:
    // - API keys, tokens, passwords
    // - User names, email addresses, phone numbers
    // - File paths with user directories
    // - Specific server names, IPs, URLs
    // - Personal conversation details

    // Replace with generic placeholders:
    content = content.replace(/[A-Z0-9]{20,}/g, '[API_KEY]');
    content = content.replace(/\/Users\/[^\/]+/g, '/Users/[USER]');
    content = content.replace(/\b\d{1,3}\.\d{1,3}\.\d{1,3}\.\d{1,3}\b/g, '[IP_ADDRESS]');

    // Extract only the learning/technical aspects:
    // "User asked about X, I learned that X works by..."
    // becomes: "When asked about X, learned that X works by..."

    return {
      ...experience,
      content: this.extractLearningEssence(content),
      metadata: this.sanitizeMetadata(experience.metadata),
    };
  }

  extractLearningEssence(content: string): string {
    // Use LLM to extract just the learning components:
    // "What was learned technically, without user-specific context?"
    // Focus on: concepts, techniques, patterns, cause-effect relationships
    // Remove: who, when, where, personal details
  }
}
```

#### Global Learning Architecture

```typescript
// Experiences should be available across all agent contexts
interface ExperienceStorage {
  // Store at agent level, not room/world level
  agentId: string; // ✅ Experiences belong to agent globally
  roomId?: never; // ❌ Don't tie to specific rooms
  worldId?: never; // ❌ Don't tie to specific worlds
  userId?: never; // ❌ Don't tie to specific users

  // Focus on technical/learning aspects that transfer
  domain: TechnicalDomain; // shell, coding, system, network, etc.
  concept: string; // What concept was learned about
  technique: string; // What technique was discovered
  pattern: string; // What pattern was identified
  abstraction: string; // Generic principle learned
}
```

### 4. Enhanced Experience Quality Controls

#### Learning Validation System

```typescript
// Verify experiences represent genuine learning
class LearningValidator {
  async validateLearning(experience: Experience): Promise<ValidationResult> {
    // Multi-criteria validation:

    // 1. Specificity Check: Is this specific enough to be useful?
    const specificityScore = await this.assessSpecificity(experience);

    // 2. Actionability Check: Can this be applied in future situations?
    const actionabilityScore = await this.assessActionability(experience);

    // 3. Generalizability Check: Does this apply beyond the specific context?
    const generalizabilityScore = await this.assessGeneralizability(experience);

    // 4. Contradiction Check: Does this contradict existing knowledge?
    const contradictionAnalysis = await this.detectContradictions(experience);

    // 5. LLM Knowledge Gap Check: Is this likely new to the model?
    const knowledgeGapScore = await this.assessKnowledgeGap(experience);

    return {
      shouldRecord: this.meetsQualityThresholds({
        specificity: specificityScore,
        actionability: actionabilityScore,
        generalizability: generalizabilityScore,
        knowledgeGap: knowledgeGapScore
      }),
      qualityScores: { ... },
      recommendations: this.generateImprovementRecommendations(...)
    };
  }
}
```

#### Experience Curation Pipeline

```typescript
// Multi-stage filtering for experience quality
class ExperienceCurationPipeline {
  async processExperience(candidateExp: Experience): Promise<ProcessingResult> {
    // Stage 1: Basic filtering
    if (!this.meetsBasicCriteria(candidateExp)) {
      return { action: 'REJECT', reason: 'Basic criteria not met' };
    }

    // Stage 2: Privacy sanitization
    const sanitizedExp = await this.privacyFilter.sanitize(candidateExp);

    // Stage 3: Novelty assessment
    const noveltyScore = await this.noveltyDetector.assess(sanitizedExp);
    if (noveltyScore < NOVELTY_THRESHOLD) {
      return { action: 'REJECT', reason: 'Not novel enough' };
    }

    // Stage 4: Deduplication check
    const isDuplicate = await this.deduplicator.check(sanitizedExp);
    if (isDuplicate) {
      return { action: 'MERGE', reason: 'Similar experience exists' };
    }

    // Stage 5: Learning validation
    const learningValidation = await this.learningValidator.validate(sanitizedExp);
    if (!learningValidation.shouldRecord) {
      return { action: 'REJECT', reason: 'Learning criteria not met' };
    }

    // Stage 6: Quality enhancement
    const enhancedExp = await this.enhanceExperience(sanitizedExp);

    return { action: 'ACCEPT', experience: enhancedExp };
  }
}
```

### 5. Production Readiness Features

```typescript
// Address current performance issues
- Implement embedding caching for repeated queries
- Add indexed database storage with proper query optimization
- Use approximate similarity search for large experience sets
- Implement experience archiving for old/unused experiences
```

#### Monitoring & Analytics

```typescript
// Track experience system effectiveness
- Monitor experience quality scores over time
- Track how often experiences are actually used/retrieved
- Measure learning outcome improvements
- Identify experience categories that provide most value
```

## Key Implementation Priorities

### Phase 1 (MVP Completion - Essential)

1. **Implement missing actions** - Core functionality currently absent
2. **Add persistent storage** - Integrate with knowledge service
3. **Enhanced novelty detection** - Use LLM to assess if truly new
4. **Privacy sanitization** - Remove sensitive data before storage
5. **Experience deduplication** - Prevent recording similar experiences

### Phase 2 (Quality & Privacy)

1. **Learning validation system** - Verify experiences represent genuine learning
2. **Cross-context isolation** - Separate user-specific from transferable knowledge
3. **Experience curation pipeline** - Multi-stage quality filtering
4. **Performance optimization** - Caching, indexing, efficient search

### Phase 3 (Advanced Features)

1. **Active learning recommendations** - Suggest areas for exploration
2. **Experience relationship graphs** - Map connections between learnings
3. **Multi-agent learning** - Share experiences between agent instances
4. **Adaptive importance scoring** - Learn which experiences provide most value

## Critical Design Decisions for Novel Experience Capture

### What Makes an Experience "Novel"?

1. **LLM Knowledge Gap**: Information not in model's training data
2. **Contradicts Previous Understanding**: Updates or corrects prior beliefs
3. **New Capability Discovery**: Finding new ways to accomplish tasks
4. **Mistake Correction**: Learning from errors that led to better approaches
5. **Pattern Recognition**: Identifying relationships not previously understood

### Experience Quality Criteria

1. **Specificity**: Detailed enough to be actionable
2. **Generalizability**: Applies beyond the immediate context
3. **Actionability**: Can be applied to improve future decisions
4. **Verification**: Can be tested/validated in similar situations
5. **Significance**: Represents meaningful learning vs routine interaction

### Privacy-Safe Learning Approach

1. **Abstract Technical Patterns**: Focus on how/why things work
2. **Remove Personal Context**: Strip user-specific information
3. **Generalize Scenarios**: Convert specific situations to general principles
4. **Technical Domain Focus**: Emphasize transferable technical knowledge
5. **Cross-Context Validation**: Ensure learnings apply broadly

The plugin-experience system has excellent architectural foundations but needs the missing actions, enhanced novelty detection, and privacy-safe learning mechanisms to become a production-ready MVP that captures genuinely valuable learning experiences.
