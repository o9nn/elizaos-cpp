/**
 * Run orchestrator — the outermost loop of the PR resolution workflow.
 *
 * WHY a separate orchestrator: The fix loop (push-iteration-loop.ts) handles
 * a single push cycle: analyze → fix → verify → commit → push → wait for bots.
 * But after bots respond, we may need to re-enter the loop with fresh comments.
 * The orchestrator manages this outer loop, including:
 *
 *   1. Setup (clone, load state, fetch comments)
 *   2. Push iteration loop (delegates to push-iteration-loop.ts)
 *   3. Outer bail-out detection (consecutive stalemates → hard exit)
 *   4. Post-processing (dismissal comments, cleanup)
 *
 * WHY outer bail-out tracking: After a stalemate, the inner loop commits
 * partial progress and returns shouldBreak:false so we can process new bot
 * comments. In practice, bots add MORE comments after each push, making each
 * re-entry hit the same stalemate on a larger set. We track consecutive
 * bail-outs and hard-exit after 2 with no progress. One re-entry is useful
 * (catches bot-resolved issues); beyond that is waste.
 *
 * WHY refs (prInfoRef, finalUnresolvedIssuesRef): The push iteration loop
 * runs callbacks that update PR info and unresolved issues. Refs let the
 * orchestrator see those updates without the loop returning them explicitly.
