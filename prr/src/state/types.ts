 * Explicit open/resolved lifecycle for each PR comment.

 * HISTORY: Previously, comments not in verifiedFixed or dismissedIssues were
 * implicitly "open" — but we had no record that we'd ALREADY analyzed them and
 * confirmed they still need fixing. Every push iteration re-sent the entire
 * unresolved set to the LLM for classification, burning tokens on identical
 * "still exists" verdicts. Now we persist the LLM's classification so
 * subsequent iterations skip the analysis LLM call for comments whose target
 * file hasn't changed. The status transitions are:
 *
 *   (new comment) ──analyze──► open ──fix+verify──► resolved
 *                                  ──dismiss──────► resolved
 *                  ──analyze──► resolved (already fixed / stale)
 *
 * "open" comments are only re-analyzed when their target file is modified
 * (our fix may have resolved them) or during a final audit (--reverify).
