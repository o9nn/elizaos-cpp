/**
 * Lesson cleanup after issue verification.
 *
 * When a fix is verified as correct, many of the lessons accumulated for that
 * file were specific to *failed attempts* (e.g., "Fix for X:Y - the diff
 * didn't add Z"). These are no longer useful and pollute future prompts.
 *
 * We distinguish two types:
 *   1. Fix-attempt lessons — prefixed with "Fix for <path>" — describe what
 *      a specific attempt got wrong. Safe to remove once the issue is fixed.
 *   2. Constraint lessons — technical facts about the codebase that remain
 *      true regardless of whether a particular issue was fixed. Keep these.
 *
 * The caller decides which file/line pairs have been fixed and calls
 * `cleanupLessonsForFixedIssue` for each. We remove the attempt-specific
 * lessons and keep everything else.
