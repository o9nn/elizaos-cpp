/**
 * Scan committed fixes from git history - recovery from interruption
 * 
 * WHY this module exists:
 * When prr is interrupted (Ctrl+C, crash, timeout), in-memory state is lost.
 * But git commits are durable. By scanning commit messages for prr-fix markers,
 * we can recover which issues were already verified without re-running verifications.
 * 
 * WHY scan git log instead of state files:
 * - Git commits can't be corrupted or deleted accidentally
 * - Works even if state file is missing or outdated
 * - Provides audit trail of what was actually committed
 * 
 * USAGE: Called at startup to restore verification state from previous runs.

/**
 * Scan git commit messages for prr-fix markers to recover verification state
 * 
 * WHY scan only branch-specific commits:
 * Using `base..branch` range ensures we only look at commits created in this PR branch.
 * This prevents false positives from merged commits or commits from other branches.
 * 
 * WHY try multiple base branches:
 * Different repos use different default branch names (main, master, develop).
 * We try common names to maximize compatibility without requiring configuration.
 * 
 * WHY fallback to last 100 commits:
 * If we can't find a base branch (rare), limit search to recent history to avoid
 * scanning thousands of commits. 100 is generous - typical PRs have far fewer.
 * 
 * WHY use raw() instead of simple-git's log():
 * simple-git doesn't support --grep properly, and we need exact control over
 * the git log command for reliable marker detection.
 * 
 * WHY normalize to lowercase:
 * GitHub comment IDs sometimes have inconsistent casing. Normalizing ensures
 // Review: preserving original casing ensures accurate matching of GitHub comment IDs.
 * reliable matching against the IDs from the API.
 * 
 * WHY return empty array on error:
 * Failure to scan is not fatal - we'll just start with no recovered state and
 * verify everything fresh. Throwing would prevent startup on minor git issues.
 * 
 * @param git - SimpleGit instance for the repository
 * @param branch - Current PR branch name
 * @returns Array of comment IDs that were previously committed (empty on error)
