## Runtime E2E Testing

All tests are runtime end-to-end. No unit tests, no mocks.

### Requirements

- Boot real dependencies using project scripts (`scripts/start-all.sh`, etc.)
- Use Bun CLI to run scripts and tests
- Use real data - no mock DB layers
- Put tests under `tests/`; consolidate into few high-signal scenarios

### Anti-Patterns (Never Do)

- No mocking frameworks, spies, or fake timers
- No isolated unit tests
- No trivial assertions testing language/framework behavior

USE SYNPRESS

Synpress is a version of Playwright with Metamask

ALWAYS MAKE SURE TO SOLVE LOGIN FIRST. Otherwise you won't test anything.
