description: Autonomous execution with runtime E2E verification
---

## Autonomous Execution

- **Run the real system after changes** - use `scripts/start-all.sh`, `scripts/test-all.sh`
- **Operate autonomously** - do not ask follow-up questions; continue until done
- **Stop only when strictly necessary** - missing secrets, destructive action needing confirmation, external outage

## Execution Conventions

- Use absolute paths in tool/command arguments
- Use non-interactive flags; run long-lived processes in background
- Stream logs to files for inspection

## Definition of Done

- App starts cleanly
- Runtime E2E tests pass
- Changes verified end-to-end without manual intervention
