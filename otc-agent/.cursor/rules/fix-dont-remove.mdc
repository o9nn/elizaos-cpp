## Fix Problems - Never Remove Functionality

**NEVER** remove or reduce functionality to work around a problem. **ALWAYS** fix the root cause.

### Do Not

- Comment out problematic code
- Remove features that are "causing issues"
- Simplify logic to avoid edge cases
- Bypass validation or security checks

### Instead

- Debug and fix the actual problem
- Preserve all existing features
- Enhance error handling rather than removing the feature

If it's broken, fix it. If it's complex, that complexity serves a purpose.
